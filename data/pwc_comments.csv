"great report! Especially the higher labour productivity in sectors which are exposed to AI. That's what we have seen in our research as well, when we looked at the IT-industry and the impact on productivity in conjunction with jobs due to the usage of AI. Short story: we're lacking behind in digitalization (especially in Europe), hence the reason why we need thousands of software engineers in the next years. By leveraging AI and the productivity increase we do have a chance to close the gap in terms of level of digitalization. Details can be found here:

"The ability to use ecosystem strategies is the edge that differentiates a first-rate organization from the rest. 
Here are three key steps that boards and the C-Suite members can take for the empowerment of this agency of the ecosystem managers:
-Strategic Clarity and Autonomy: The strategic objectives of the ecosystem need to be explicitly defined, and the managers need to design for themselves the discretion that allows them to act in that direction. This requires clear expectations to be set and freedom in execution to adapt to changing market conditions.
-Foster a Culture of Collaboration: Instill a culture of collaboration and accessible communication at all organizational levels and with external partners. Do away with silos and develop an open environment where not only are ecosystem managers supported, but they are encouraged to get out and create relationships.
-Invest in Skills and Resources: Endue the required skills, tools, and resources in the ecosystem managers that can make them successful. It will be worthwhile to make available to them training programs, exposure to state-of-the-art technologies, and the requisite budgetary support enabling them to take part in innovative enterprises.

"Interesting, but I think a broader scope is required. The workforce is now more mobile and transitory than it has ever been. Execs are already lining up new roles whilst in post, because the short term KPI's are achievable, but the long term ones aren't. This is a mindset of the broader workforce too, who's stability has been removed by a property market becoming far less accessible, a tech environment that absorbs a great deal of investment for what is flashy but unremarkable outputs, and a realisation of growth as a form of entropy and not a guarantee of success.
Business leaders need to think more broadly, strategically and with solidarity. No future is guaranteed and every plan is only as good as it's acceptable failed state.

Understanding failure is more important than ambition, as it is far more common and has far more interesting outcomes. They are a duality, one always trailing the other, inseparable. So I'd add that to the differentiators, imagine failure and what you could achieve from it. Alongside, stability, what do you need to survive in ever changing circumstances, what isn't changing that could give your business a baseline to fall back on when the changes have made everything else redundant.

Empowering employees - In the fast paced business environment, companies cannot just depend on the top layer leadership to come up with innovation ideas. It is always important to seek ideas & suggestions from employees.
Adopting new procedures & strategies - We cannot bring innovation or efficiencies with same mentality which we had while starting new process. Continuous evaluation of process by performing service delivery audits is key to identify the areas of improvements.
Remove the waste - In the work environment, the only waste we can identify is the waste of time. Need to look at the process at minute level and have to assess how better we are utilizing the time and resources of the employees.
Technological Advancements - Make use of the new technological advancements in the industry such as artificial intelligence, machine learning to make the processes more efficient
Risk Assessment - Thorough risk assessments at process level and organization level will provide insights on the threats and vulnerabilities. This helps to deploy proper controls and action plans to make the processes free from any risks.

"While the report highlights important trends in consumer behavior, it also raises questions about the efficacy of current business strategies. It's concerning to see that despite the increasing reliance on technology and the emphasis on sustainability, there's still a significant disconnect between consumer preferences and the actions of many brands and retailers. Are businesses truly leveraging technology to enhance the shopping experience, or are they simply adding more layers of complexity? And when it comes to sustainability, are companies genuinely committed to meaningful change, or is it just another marketing tactic?

"Read several survey reports on AI by PwC, by the way, I used to do similar surveys while working at PwC years ago. 

I am advising a research project on the use of GenAI tools by students. The Reason for this research is that as businesses increasingly integrate AI into their operations, understanding college students' adoption, use, preferences, and loyalty towards GenAI technologies is crucial for all businesses.

Here are a few of our interim findings:
First, there is an impressive endorsement of GenAI among those students who actually use GenAI tools for academic purposes!

‚úÖ  Positive Reception: 71.1%
A significant majority of the students using of GenAI Tools would recommend GenAI tools to classmates for academic tasks, implying the perceived benefits and satisfaction with these tools in academic settings.

‚úÖ  Conditional Recommendations:  7.2%
A small portion of students show willingness to recommend GenAI Tools depending on factors such as the study subject, the specific tasks.

üö´  Resistance to GenAI: 14.5%
14.5% of the respondents would not recommend, this may be due to many reasons such as negative experiences or ethical concerns...etc.

"Generative AI is a game-changer, particularly in its capacity to empower employees with the right tools and knowledge for superior job performance. It can free up valuable time, allowing workers to apply their expertise more effectively and efficiently. This not only enhances the quality of work but also accelerates the pace of innovation and operation in technically demanding fields.

However, the corollary is that tasks which used to require multiple hands may now be managed by fewer individuals, presenting a challenge from an employment perspective. It‚Äôs crucial we address this transformative shift with a strategy that also considers the workforce's evolution.

With relatable content that reflects my passion, I aim to foster meaningful discussions and debunk misconceptions.

The outcomes from these projects underscore how partnerships and skilled volunteering can catalyze sustainable change. PwC is setting an example for corporate citizenship and purpose-driven service that's worth celebrating not just on IVD but every day.

"Climate change, referred to frequently here, presents its challenges but, until there is a clear-eyed and realistic understanding of the true causes, businesses will be chasing phantoms and travelling along the wrong track. 
Climate change has been the norm for 3 billion years and it is futile to plan the future chasing carbon reduction as the salve. Businesses, large and small, must plan to accept its inevitablity and devote resources where they will really assist with effectively adapting to the effects.

"That is an interesting sentiment as well as an honest one. 

I suspect the bigger a company is the harder it will be to change and adapt, in addition to that, also more costly. 

Even so, those who are willing to go through the pain of change and bear the costs will reap the benefits. The time, however, is now to act and one of the first things companies need to do is upskill their staff, executives and

"Very critical area that does not always get as much attention as it deserves. Demand reduction is in many ways the best path forward instead of expending resources to reduce energy carbon intensity or replace high emitting energy sources, simply using less both avoids GHG emissions and reduces costs.

Automated Demand side management is key for the Kingdom Energy Vision as it's now a mature technology.
"With climate change in mind, it won't be enough to address energy supply without first looking at the 3Rs. So by looking at reducing energy use, consideration should be done on the demand in place. The same applies to reuse and recycle. Energy supply cannot be looked at in isolation, therefore demand management is the first button."

"Myth #4 - PWC say:"" Generative AI doesn't think...."" This in my opinion is inaccurate to a large degree. If the word ""think"" is limited to a definition of ""create a new idea as yet undiscovered or defined"" then maybe - maybe at best you could say Generative AI doesn't think. But if you allow ""thinking"" to include, planning, assimilating information, acting on information, rational explanations of phenomena and concepts, etc. etc. then Generative AI does ""think"". We need to understand that a lot of the ""thinking"" we pay people to do today (for example, researching nto a topic and present the findings, which is a very low level example) is going to be done far better, faster and cheaper with Generative AI.

"In the business world knowledge depth is vitally important if not critical. Professional or academic learning is a great fast track to acquire knowledge in a short space of time, though the chosen fields may not match the skill sets of an individual. 

When the opportunities are not allowing the learning to be practiced and challenged, acquired knowledge base can drown during work life. Whilst having tools to bring out skill sets individuals posses during secondary education can allow the person to make wise choices early, only the skill set alone may not be sufficient to move forward.

Varied professions require varied skills and it needs multi skill set to be applied in diverse circumstances. Not all can lead not all can perform not all can research not all can be analytical!

At the end we must have a strong desire and the willingness to dive deep to the experience-experiment, take risks to expand, further knowledge and sharpen skills to be successful to reap benefits. It is about value that we create what matters, education and diverse skill set are tools we use to progress.

It's fascinating to see how large corporations are leveraging tech-enabled management to navigate these turbulent waters, optimizing working capital to secure a competitive edge. 

Yet, the real opportunity lies with small and mid-sized businesses. While these entities may currently lag in harnessing similar technological prowess, the potential for transformation and growth is immense. The journey towards tech-enabled working capital optimization is not just a necessity but a strategic move to future-proof businesses against the ebb and flow of economic tides.

Let's dive deeper into how technology can be the great equalizer in the optimization game, turning challenges into opportunities for businesses of all sizes. The path forward is illuminated by innovation, and it's time for small and mid-sized companies to step into the spotlight.

"Very glad that more and more enterprises pay attention on the energy saving. It's eye-opening that companies spend over US$10 trillion on energy annually. This isn't just a budget line; it's a wake-up call to rethink how we use energy. But here's the real game-changer: shifting towards sustainable energy isn't just good for the planet; it's smart business strategy.

Embracing renewable energy and efficiency technologies isn't just about cutting costs or reducing carbon footprints. It's a powerful statement about a company's commitment to sustainable development. This shift isn't just environmentally responsible; it's a strategic move that aligns with the values of a growing eco-conscious consumer base and investors. It's about building resilience, staying ahead of regulatory curves, and leading in an increasingly green economy.

In a nutshell, tapping into sustainable energy solutions is more than a trend; it's a vital step in future-proofing businesses. It's not just about being green; it's about being smart, proactive, and competitive in a world where sustainability is increasingly the norm.

"Great initiative PwC ! How thoughtful to add the most important task of house chores, and equally satisfying to see, irrespective of the participants gender, this indeed seems to be a priority for all. I'm hopeful of the future where AI can do house chores, while we and all the young men, women and others who're starting on their career journeys, can use the rest of the time more productively.

"This is golden PwC. Every data point lining up with what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. I didn't see a breakdown by job function, but my guess is:

- the great resignation 
- desire for innovation, transformation
- need for modern tools
- comfort with AI
- and other trends...

...are all more pronounced in the office of finance than most departments.

That CFOs are losing sleep as much as, if not more than CEOs.

"A skills-first approach is a pragmatic way to deal with talent shortages.

In the current world we live in, change is happening at exponential rates, particularly technological change and digital disruption, which now underpin the fabric of most of our lives.

The traditional education system will struggle to generate a talent pool that can meet the ever-changing needs of the marketplace.

In many instances, by the time university graduates enter the workforce, the skills they learned during their undergraduate years have become outdated.

Lifelong learning and hands-on practice are the ways for people to stay abreast of the changes in the world and remain employable.

Many individuals who don't have formal qualifications for a role are driven and have acquired skills from the vast sources of knowledge available today, such as YouTube, LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, and many others.

These driven individuals have an appetite for learning and self-education and are applying these skills in both conventional and unconventional ways.

Companies must look beyond traditional recruitment models and tap into this pool of people who acquire skills from the ""University of Life.""
