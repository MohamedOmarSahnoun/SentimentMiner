"One way is knowing your limitations and not pushing yourself to the breaking point, rely on your team to help you if they‚Äôre not as busy, it‚Äôs a team effort for a common goal in the end. Else, break down tasks and do one thing at a time, don‚Äôt stress so much about it.

Communicating what‚Äôs going on is x1000 better than getting frustrated / stressed to the point you can‚Äôt function. Its not the end of the world, it‚Äôll be here tomorrow. One step at a time is better than no steps at all.

Edit: Also leave work at work, don‚Äôt bring it home. That means, go out, rest, go to the gym, watch your favorite show, eat well, get a good night sleep.

"I take my money and spend it on a sport, or a fake sport in the middle of the day. Such as stair climbing or Jacob‚Äôs Ladder (paid service). Spending it that way keeps down the stress so I can focus on work. That way my shares through work are made more valuable because I had more energy at the time to keep my focus up. I train in logic with my heart in the aerobic zone. I train problem solving with my heart in the testing zone. So my stress is down, and my heart is not about to explode.

Always think of what makes things go faster and better, what personality has people happy and cheery.

"Most helpful for my mental health would be being able to get help when I need it. For over 2 weeks I've been desperately trying to get assistance from Facebook/Meta. My email and Facebook were hacked. The hackers linked their Instagram to my FB profile, causing my account to be suspended and disabled. All the information on the help page requires that I'm logged into my FB, or the hackers Instagram. I can't do either. I send emails everyday, but no one responds. I signed my Instagram up with Meta verified support, thinking they could help me get the hackers Instagram unlinked- and assist me with my FB, but they won't.. Waste of money and infuriating. I paid some company $100 to help me, it was a scam. I'm now trying my state legislators, out of desperation.

I can't imagine losing 16+ years of photos, videos, and memories with my children, friends and family. Please Meta! Help me!

"Dear Facebook Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you with an urgent
issue regarding my Facebook account, which has recently been disabled.
My account, which I have had for over 10 years, contains significant
personal data and memories, including photos, messages, and
connections with friends and family. The reason provided for the disabling of my account is that it was linked to an Instagram account that is not mine. I assure you that I have not authorized any such linkage, and I am deeply concerned about the security of my account. Furthermore, I am currently running paid advertisements for an event through my Facebook account. This event is time-sensitive, and the disabling of my account has disrupted my ability to manage these ads effectively. Please, could you urgently review my case and take the necessary steps to reinstate my Facebook account? I am eager to regain access to my profile and continue utilizing Facebook's services responsibly. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift
resolution.

That's really the number 1 goal for nearly every business out there - to sell. Sure, there are nuances - what can be sold, what should and shouldn't be sold, can X be sold using the same approach as Y - but, ultimately, we're in the business of selling.

"Figure. It. Out. - the three words that describe every position I've held in my career so far.

I am a victim of an exploitation in Meta's services, perhaps a malicious hacker, or poorly implemented AI scanning, which led to my Instagram and Facebook accounts being permanently disabled on May 8th, 2024. Like many users, my FB account has 16 years of memories, photos, conversations, and connections with family, friends, and former colleagues that I have known for decades.

It seems that the most recent security breaches, vulnerabilities and incidents are all but being ignored by Meta support staff. Users are being told they are at fault for violating a Community Guideline but given no further details. Without having an attorney or legal complaint, they are told this account has been removed permanently and they can no longer use these sites.

There are quite a few YouTube videos from creators who offer services to have an Instagram account banned OR to recover a disabled account, of course, for a fee. There are even comments on the Meta threads here offering the same service. Sadly, they are much more proactive than Meta has been itself, so far.

Hello - please can someone help me - my account has been hacked. I have personal doctors that im in touch with on my account and cant access my email and or phone number. I have videos of my family who have sadly passed away - please can someone contact me asap?
I received a 1099-MISC that does not correspond to any activity on any of my Meta-related accounts (for which there was no financial activity). I cannot find a way to communicate this to Facebook/Meta. It is either an error or fraud. Is there any kind of customer service phone number anywhere?

And it's not just me having issues. There are lots of reports about scammers pretending to be Meta, mostly from Vietnam. They're stealing verified pages and using them for shady deals.

The real support team at Meta doesn't seem to be listening to our requests or paying attention to the information we're giving them. It feels like they're just not very good at dealing with this problem, which is worrying for everyone involved.

You cannot treat your customers like this and hire such incompetent and ineffective cybersecurity firms. Please, do something about it!

"Meta might be a good company to work for but since it started working with social media sites, including Facebook, they have either closed down accounts including pages, prevented people from posting comments, for short periods of time, or disallowed links, including public information ones, from being shared, without giving any reason as to why they have done this, apart from using automated comments, such as ""Doesn't abide by their standards"", so I think they need to start saying why and give people the chance to challenge their decision, which could be done through messaging them!

Ultimately, I‚Äôm trying to get some help to reinstate my account.

This surprise action has rendered me useless and is now costing me time and money, not to mention that of my clients. Kindly push this message on to whoever needs to see it and get back to me.

I find it in poor taste that the many many accounts that are impersonating me on Facebook are allowed to stand, after filing many complaints for impersonation, with Facebook even saying ""they did nothing wrong"".

If an acct is flagged as compromised why are the hackers still able to post. There is no reason why an account should still be activated if it was reported as being hacked! The account should‚Äôve been temporarily deactivated until all matters has been resolved. The hackers are trying to scam people into purchasing a car and has successfully received a payment from a friend of mine. They are now also posting inappropriate photos that are supposedly me. My anxiety is at a high at this point and will be reaching out to a lawyer regarding this ongoing issues. I know for a fact that there‚Äôs other people going through the same problem.

"I cherished my Facebook account, dedicating 15 years to curating and cultivating connections with like-minded individuals, business contacts, and even extended family members I've never met. I actively engaged in fostering business groups and supporting niche communities. However, one morning, I woke to a notification abruptly canceling my account with no avenue for appeal or clarification on the supposed breach of a vague community standard.

Meta's treatment of its userbase‚Äîor should I say, their target base‚Äîreeks of contempt.

In the months since, I've encountered countless individuals who've suffered similar mistreatment from a company that boasts about fostering connections but fails to exhibit such behaviour.

What's worse, Meta seems inactive in addressing scammers and charlatans making false claims about account recovery.

Shame on you, Meta. Your behaviour is shameful, shameful indeed.

It's quite an interesting observation definitely worthy of further research. If an environment needs more of this or that. The climate adapts to the needs of the environment for plants to survive. For animals to survive. For us to coexist. That's why, what we do to affect the natural flow of these paths, has to be a contribution, not a negative impact.

Soon after, we received messages on both my Founder number as well as brands official number that if we want to get our account back we need to give them 200$.

"DearI was dismayed to discover that my Facebook page has been disabled and am eager to understand the rationale behind this decision. My sole interaction with Facebook and Instagram has been through my Shopify e-commerce store. The fact that my Instagram account remains active raises questions regarding why my Facebook business account has been suspended.

The notification I received cited the suspension of my account due to its association with an Instagram account under the username Xpjeoe2kqfhc3zdxx, which allegedly violated community guidelines. I have no knowledge of this account and fail to comprehend how its actions could result in the deactivation of my Facebook page.

Being a print-on-demand clothing brand owner, my Facebook page plays a vital role in promoting and selling my products. I implore you to thoroughly investigate this matter and either reinstate my account or allow me access to my data for rectification purposes.

The repercussions of this suspension on my business are significant, and I urgently seek your assistance in swiftly addressing this issue. I am prepared to provide any necessary information to validate the legitimacy of my business and the integrity of my online presence.

I need the support's assistance; I've been trying to get a response for days, but unfortunately, I never manage to get help.

We had a significant issue with our WhatsApp number in Meta.

When we tried to switch messaging platforms, our number appeared as pending in Waba. This caused the downfall of our service operation through that channel, and we haven't been able to find a solution.

Can someone direct us to the correct channel that can assist us?

"Hi, Mikhail here.

My Instagram account @mvkbiz has been disabled, I am a verified account and a paid subscriber, I have confirmed with Meta Pro support that this is a mistake and they said that the account should be restored soon - I have not heard back anything, they said account should be reinstated Friday, December 15 and the account is still not up as of today, Tuesday December 19th.

I rely on this account to support my business, interact with my audience, and communicate with the clients for our business, which ironically enough involves running close to $5,000,000 per year in ad spend on Facebook.

This is affecting us and our business in a very negative way.

I have submitted ID verification, and am a verified account, so this should have never happened in the first place.

"Subject: Complaint Regarding Missing ""Professional Mode"" Option on Wife's Facebook Account

Dear Facebook support team,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding the absence of the ""Professional Mode"" option on my wife's Facebook account. As avid users of both Facebook and LinkedIn, we value the professional networking features provided by both platforms.

However, despite numerous attempts to enable the professional mode feature on her Facebook account, we have been unable to locate it. This limitation has hindered her ability to fully utilize Facebook for professional networking and engagement purposes.

We kindly request that the Facebook team investigate this matter and provide a solution or explanation for the absence of the professional mode option. We believe that having access to this feature would greatly enhance her experience on the platform and align it more closely with her professional goals.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this issue.

"Don't tell lies, it is clearly evident by the replies on your other posts, and including this one, that you care nothing for helping people around the world to keep connected. As evidenced by the plethora of posts with the same story, of their accounts, sometimes over decades old accounts, being closed for no discernible reason, or of accounts being hacked and no way to retrieve an account, because you simply do not reply!

Personally, I even went as far as sending an old style, physical, telegram and got no response.

My over a decade old account was suddenly disabled by Facebook, you DISCONNECTED me from family, from friends, from cousins, from business partners, from support structures, YOU DISCONNECTED ME. I still don't know why. Believe me I've been over the T's & Cs and can't find anything.

Oh, and the side effect of your refusal to communicate, an implied support of criminal hacker activity from people who claim they can help me.

"I am writing to you in a state of distress and desperation, as my Facebook account has been hacked, and I find myself in a helpless situation. I have taken every possible step to regain control, but so far, I have been met with unresponsiveness and a lack of assistance from your support team.
My Facebook account was hacked by an unknown individual who not only changed my email address but also added two-factor authentication without my consent. This has made it impossible for me to regain access to my account through the traditional recovery methods.
What's even more concerning is that the hacker, who currently has control of my account, is using it to post almost nude pictures of random women. I am deeply troubled by this unethical and illegal activity that is taking place under my name, and I fear the damage this may cause to my personal and professional reputation.
I have already tried reaching out to your support team through the official channels provided on your website, but to my dismay, I have received no response or help whatsoever. I understand that you handle a vast number of issues daily, but the urgency and severity of my situation require immediate attention.

My Instagram account @mvkbiz has been disabled, I am a verified account and a paid subscriber, I have confirmed with Meta Pro support that this is a mistake and they said that the account should be restored soon - I have not heard back anything, they said account should be reinstated Friday, December 15 and the account is still not up as of today, Tuesday December 19th.

I rely on this account to support my business, interact with my audience, and communicate with the clients for our business, which ironically enough involves running close to $5,000,000 per year in ad spend on Facebook.

"As of now, Meta being down has sparked widespread speculation and concern among users worldwide. While the exact reason for the outage remains unconfirmed, several potential factors could be contributing to this disruption.

One likely explanation could be technical issues within Meta's infrastructure. Given the platform's immense scale and complexity, even minor glitches or malfunctions in critical systems could cascade into a widespread outage, impacting services like Facebook

Another possibility is a cyberattack or security breach targeting Meta's systems. With cyber threats evolving in sophistication and frequency, it's not uncommon for major tech companies to fall victim to such attacks, leading to service disruptions and compromising user data.

Furthermore, the possibility of a deliberate act of sabotage cannot be ruled out entirely. Whether motivated by ideological reasons, financial gain, or other factors, individuals or groups with malicious intent may seek to disrupt Meta's services for various reasons.

However, if discriminatory practices are present, it undermines the integrity of your hiring process and deprives deserving candidates of the opportunity to work with your esteemed organization.

Therefore, I appeal to you to investigate our applications to ensure that the hiring process is fair and unbiased. I also request that you provide me with feedback on my application, including the criteria used to evaluate it, so that I can improve my chances of securing a job in the future.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

My Instagram account @beingpahadino1 has been deactivated by a anonymous unauthorised person with falsely reporting copyright claim using a temporary email id


I never violated any communication guidelines i have all the persimmon and evidence to support my statement, i uploaded all of them still i didnt get positive response,

I have invested my 6 years on this account ,it was the only source of my income, now its totally ruined

I am facing this situation without doing anything wrong


Having all the related evidence and permission still didnt get my account back

But that person ruining my career as a influencer with all the bad intentions doing falsw copyright claim

He is having fun enjoying life banning other people accounts , making them suffer

I use Facebook for my charity and Meta has locked me out of my account saying it‚Äôs linked to a bad Instagram account, which is actually an Instagram that I never created. 

Now, thanks to Facebook & META, I have no access to private photo albums I created for orphans in Malawi so that they can have a record of their lives once they turn 18 - without these albums they have no photos of their history.

Who can I speak with about this to reinstate my Facebook account so I can move everything to a safer platform? This event has proven that Facebook is a shockingly unsafe place to keep shared albums for my charity.

We have had articles written about us and your platform have written books and we have become an asset to the trucking community.
the claim was retracted and they stated that it was a meta mistake, and the AI must have identified it incorrectly. Everything was done as asked and we sent in documentation showing it was a Meta AI error. No one cared or even responded with help. My account was just deleted and the money we had earned we were told was gone. Since Sunday I have been on the phone day and night with Meta Business and it‚Äôs the same thing. Fill out a form and it will be reviewed. They end the chat before we are even finished. When they call they promise my account will be restored in a couple hours and it never is.

However, it might be a nightmare for your customers or users. Personally, I have found it extremely challenging to reach your support team. There is no contact information provided, not even a contact form. While I understand that you may not have the resources to offer live support 24/7, I believe it is crucial to provide some form of live support to your users. Even if you can only offer live support during specific hours of the day or provide a support email address, it would be a valuable service to your customers. I am also concerned about the legality of not offering live support to your users. In some countries, it is illegal for companies to neglect customer support. I am unsure if this is the case in your country, but I would appreciate it if you could address this issue.

"Meta on LinkedIn has become a place where abused and soon-to-be disaffected users vent their frustration with the lack of or obtuse customer service. If anyone spent 30 seconds looking at my account, it would be restored to me. Instead, I have spent over 200 hours over the last year trying to get someone to listen, look, and restore my account since 2007. 
My account has become the family photo album, diary, journal, and connection to friends and family, living and dead.
I did not violate the terms of service
I will never give up.

"Hi Facebook team.
At Thu, Feb 29, 1:59PM my ""Syed Rasel Ahmed"" Facebook account was hacked by a hacker. He hacked my ID and removed me from admin. Now I can't even access my ID, he has changed my facebook password. And after some time Facebook disabled my id after realizing that it was hacked, I want to recover my id.

Verified my Facebook ID with my voter ID card. I have taken the paid meta blue sign once. I have several Facebook pages in my ID and one of them has been removed by hackers from my ID.

I can provide all kinds of evidence

When do you guys finally revolutionize business communication and provide a real smart concept in your platform?

According to FORRESTER, a Unified Interface combining all communication channels like e-mail, Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram etc., tasks, and data has a market potential of 30bn USD per year.
Read this study:

100% of surveyed knowledge workers confirm that email is the No. 1 communication channel for business communication, the majority expects email and messaging will become EVEN MORE IMPORTANT in the future; just 47% say that messenger are important to get the job done (but for sure they are becoming more and more important)

51% find it challenging to keep an overview and document relevant information that is distributed in different email threads and chats

71% want a unified interface for emails and messaging

70% want a tool that provides timeline and deadline clarity

63% desire having a tool to get to Inbox Zero

Why not combining Meta with all communication channel and a really cool task manger in a SMART way. And turn it into THE leading Business Communication Platform?!

30bn USD per year (according to FORRESTER) should worth a look at least ;-).

"Dear representative,

I recently discovered that my Facebook page has been disabled, and I am deeply concerned about the reasons behind this decision. The only integration I have ever had with Facebook and Instagram is through my Shopify e-commerce store. My Instagram account is still active, which leads me to question why my Facebook business account has been disabled.

I received a message stating that my account was suspended because it was linked to an Instagram account with the username Xpjeoe2kqfhc3zdxx, which apparently does not follow your rules. I have no knowledge of this account and do not understand why it would lead to the suspension of my Facebook page.

"I lost my iPhone a few days ago, and it was associated with the Microsoft Authenticator app. This app generates a code on the phone to access my Instagram accounts.

This type of restriction is an abusive practice because all my posts and my account follow all Facebook rules and terms of use.

Do we have to sue Facebook for abusive practices?

There is a limit to everything, this type of attitude from the platform is too much, it constitutes an abusive practice. This is why I am in favor of the legalization of digital platforms, creating laws so that an account can only be deactivated or blocked by court order.

Society cannot be held hostage by abusive practices on the platform, as Facebook, in addition to being a social network, makes money from advertisements, becoming a private company and publishing at the same time.

"Meta head of reality, yet not grasping the impact of the actions done against users"
Why are so many Facebook users finding their accounts closed or cancelled? Why can they not find answers to this question?
"FB DISABLED MY ACCOUNT!
Well this is new. I got a notification today that my Fb account was disabled. Apparently and according to Fb someone in Vietnam got into my account. They then linked their own IG account and did something against Fb TOS and got it shut down. Now I have no means of reconnecting to Fb through that route.
So searching around and around on the Fb help pages and going through seemingly endless circles, I decided to take my search to YouTube. I found a few videos of people who also experienced a sudden disabling of their accounts and they offered some of their own suggestions which I've tried a few of.
The real problem is that while I run multiple Fb business pages and groups of my own for my businesses and music etc., I also admin those of clients. With my personal page in limbo, I am now rendered helpless. My pages/groups now have no owner/admin while I try to get my account reactivated. I did make a new Fb account so clients could at least add me back as admin so we wouldn't lose time. But I mean come on, this is truly unethical of Fb. They have interfered with my livelihood and that of my clients without any warning or provocation. In my book, its just plain unethical!

While it allows criminals in every area, on every page, the algorithm it has established will never allow you.

If you just type this it will be called spam. ""this is not true""

A scammer says he will make you rich.
A pervert invites his daughters to his home.

Meta says;

You will just watch this evil world I created.

This is a crime against humanity.

The meta supports the criminals' monologue.

Look at my freedom here. You can't make this meta either.

And please. Don't sell LinkedIn.

Because the task given to this man is:

Make people enemies of each other. Block them from communicating...

You are giving in to the hijacker, the terrorist.
You are siding with the hijacker instead of the innocent user.

Return my Facebook and Instagram accounts to me immediately.
My next step will be to bring legal action.

"I have been desperately seeking help to regain access to my disabled accounts that were BOTH verified. On December 4th I was ""permanently"" disabled for supposedly posting child n*dity on IG which I didn't do. There is ZERO customer support available, even though I was paying to be verified, because the only way to access the support is through logging in, which I am incapable of doing from a disabled account.

I paid for meta verified to PROTECT my account.

It's incredibly distressing as both apps were my most lucrative marketing channel for my business, and losing access has had immediate negative impacts on my sales & revenue.

I've been begging all over LinkedIN trying to find an employee to help me, which I know meta employees are technically not allowed to do, but is the only way I have found support in the past with prior issues.

To be clear: Meta employees have helped me in the past. I'm asking for someone to please submit a ticket for me.

The system is broken and Meta is way past due in taking responsibility and providing adequate customer support for PAYING customers. I understand that they can't provide customer support for a billion users, but for those who are verified, this is unacceptable.

"Meta, you are the issue here. Your complete lack of real support within business is a plague. Zero action was or is being taken to prevent charges from hackers' ads and removal of hacker Pixels from my account - and every day, I am charged and penalised for hacker activity in my long-term business account.

I need support after the stress and anxiety you have produced META.
You are the problem here.
If you are really trying to offer support, forget this tokenistic PR and truly support the SMB's like mine that are being ruined by your practices.

"I would advise myself that before my Facebook profile is hacked make sure Facebook actually has a way for the true owner to recover their profile when the email and phone number have been changed by the hacker. Currently there is no recovery when someone changes the email and phone number and if there is it's not easily accessible. haven't been able to recover my hacked profile in 3 months. When using current hacked profile process when asked if I had access to email and phone number and I select NO, I'm put through a process where at one point I'm asked to enter a previous password and when I do Facebook acknowledges password was changed three months ago which is when the hacker changed it and then states I have to complete forgotten password request to regain control which again will only send recovery to email and phone controlled by the hacker.

sorry but I cant find the support icon to get in touch,
I have a fan page in Facebook that I was ""mysteriously"" removed from administrator and since then I can't post or control it, nor the page has an admin

It has my name of my main page Carlos Tufvesson, which is a verified account, and the same email of my personal account which is the email Im using to send you this mail.

This was in 2019, I tried several contacts with you and never had a response. the page has my name and no administrator.

"Dear Meta/Facebook Team, I have a huge rant against you all !

For the last few months, I have been hacked and my business pages on Facebook I have been removed as the admin of the pages. Every one else have been removed from their roles, and the pages are left alone.
For months, I cannot communicate nor do anything.

The most painful point is that in order to get my pages back, I followed all the links, filled all the forms, but never could have anybody from the Facebook team to take care of my concern. NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON!

And time passes, and my businesses are choking, because Meta doesn't take care of its customers (yes, I pay you, for advertisment on those pages I lost... but you guys don't care at all!)

The same problem occured on LinkedIn : within 2 working days, it was resolved, with the support of a very comprehensive team from LinkedIn. I am so sad you guys decided not to deliver quality customers relationship, but decided your client should deal with list of links and forms that will never be able to deal with all types of struggles your users go through.

I sincerely hope A HUMAN BEING from Meta/Facebook will see this and help me get in touch with the people who can solve the problem.

Waiting for your response...

"Speak up more. I was abused, homeless, hungry. I taught myself software development first as an outlet and escape from trauma, and it quickly became a passion. I bought myself a 10"" netbook in high school, had it with me in a park at one point. I would sit at Starbucks and code. I always expected I'd be rewarded for the effort, for the grit, for the drive to learn and better myself. But instead, I was largely ex0loited for my talents and simply didn't speak up enough to find a mentor for softwafe development. As peers got accepted into university, I was between caring for an elderly, a younger brother and picking myself up from the streets. I missed the mark on many things such as scholarships, simply because I had no guidance and didn't know all my options. During the bad years, I would work 11-17 hour days 7 days a week, and stay up late at night to code. I pushed customers through, but I missed a chance to reach out for a lifeline. That was my only source for networking, and you never know who might be in your field.

It's the unique experience of orphans. The best programs are not enough if young people don't have counsel on what they are. I will certainly keep that in mind too, if I ever become a parent or mentor myself.

I really think it will be more interesting and will bring more costumers. Please try to program it the way on your next version update n see am sure it will work out.

"The situation in Gaza is deeply concerning. The complete cut-off of communications and the Internet not only hampers the ability of civilians to stay informed but also puts their safety and well-being at risk. Reports of increased violence in the region, more intense than before, only compound the dire circumstances.

In this digital age, access to communication and information is a fundamental right, and the blackout in Gaza further exacerbates an already precarious situation. The international community should be vigilant and work towards re-establishing these essential communication channels to ensure that people can stay connected and informed about their surroundings.

The use of hashtags like

demonstrates the power of social media and the digital space in raising awareness and advocating for change. It is crucial for people worldwide to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza and call for an end to the violence and a restoration of their communication infrastructure.

Now, thanks to Facebook & META, I have no access to private photo albums I created for orphans in Malawi so that they can have a record of their lives once they turn 18 - without these albums they have no photos of their history.

Who can I speak with about this to reinstate my Facebook account so I can move everything to a safer platform? This event has proven that Facebook is a shockingly unsafe place to keep shared albums for my charity.

"Dear Meta Inc,

Our team have been trying to reach the customers service staff at Instagram to validate a payment discrepancy for many weeks now. We are turning to you in the hope that you can help us. 

We have been charged but the details of those charges are not reflecting on the Instagram billing or the Meta business suite. It goes directly against the Department of Economic Department Consumer Rights not to show the details of a billing transaction.

I'd like to clarify a few points:

1. The group post contained a Bubble Gun Toy, which is intended solely

2. We believe our group's content did not violate any policies copyright

"The situation in Gaza is deeply concerning. The complete cut-off of communications and the Internet not only hampers the ability of civilians to stay informed but also puts their safety and well-being at risk. Reports of increased violence in the region, more intense than before, only compound the dire circumstances.

In this digital age, access to communication and information is a fundamental right, and the blackout in Gaza further exacerbates an already precarious situation. The international community should be vigilant and work towards re-establishing these essential communication channels to ensure that people can stay connected and informed about their surroundings.

The use of hashtags like
,
, and
demonstrates the power of social media and the digital space in raising awareness and advocating for change. It is crucial for people worldwide to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza and call for an end to the violence and a restoration of their communication infrastructure.

The suffering of civilians in conflict zones is a global concern, and it is the responsibility of governments and international organizations to work towards peace and the protection of innocent lives.

Because thousands of people are experiencing login problems without being able to speak to support to send the documentation so that the account can be released.

In my case, when I disable two-factor authentication, now I can't log in because Facebook has a bug asking me to activate two-factor authentication and every time I click on activate I automatically log out of Facebook.

There is no option to speak to support because I cannot log into my account.

Also today this happened to a company I use for gifts and affected tons of their customers who were scammed!! Shame on you Facebook. This is the scam site that claimed all the merchandise was on sale for $6.28. The real company Natural Life is working on getting multiple fake sites to be taken down. Do something.

"Hello,

I need the support's assistance; I've been trying to get a response for days, but unfortunately, I never manage to get help.

We had a significant issue with our WhatsApp number in Meta.

When we tried to switch messaging platforms, our number appeared as pending in Waba. This caused the downfall of our service operation through that channel, and we haven't been able to find a solution.

Can someone direct us to the correct channel that can assist us?

My personal and business Facebook accounts have been permanently disabled and there is no one to speak to for assistance. 
You have continued to attempt to take payments from my bank account, for boosting posts on my business page that I can no longer access.
I would just like to warn anyone else with a Facebook account, that Meta cannot be trusted with our valuable businesses.
Where is the accountability on your part?
I hold out hope that you will finally respond to me.

"Hi, Mikhail here.

My Instagram account @mvkbiz has been disabled, I am a verified account and a paid subscriber, I have confirmed with Meta Pro support that this is a mistake and they said that the account should be restored soon - I have not heard back anything, they said account should be reinstated Friday, December 15 and the account is still not up as of today, Tuesday December 19th.

I rely on this account to support my business, interact with my audience, and communicate with the clients for our business, which ironically enough involves running close to $5,000,000 per year in ad spend on Facebook.

This is affecting us and our business in a very negative way.

I have submitted ID verification, and am a verified account, so this should have never happened in the first place.

Please resolve this issue and get my reinstated.

The cases tend to go this way:

1. I make a payment to Meta.
2. Almost immediately (after taking my money!), a message pops up that I need to verify the payment method.
3. I submit the request to verify my payment method along with documentation.
4. Meta's response to my submission is to disable my ad account and payment method.
5. I appeal the decision.
6. The response I am given after I again submit documentation is that my payment method has been suspended, to contact my bank to get a new credit card and to add a new payment method. Meta provides zero information about what message they are receiving that is causing a security issue or even any clues to me about this. I'm not even told if it's a problem with my documentation.
7. I have called my bank several times and each time, they cannot find any problems with my payment method.
8. This has been going around and around in circles. Each time Meta's response is to ""add a new payment method"". The problem with this is eventually, Meta disables all of a businesses' ad accounts and we run out of payment methods to use.

Meanwhile, I see tons of fraud and phishing happening on the platform.

"Yet Meta continues to close-down 12+ year accounts for NO reason, accounts of small communities, artists, volunteers, small business owners... Meta closed down my personal fb in July of 2022 for NO reason, and never gave me a reason or even a response. You can be too big to care for a limited time."

I have send many appeal to check group violation by human but unfortunately I am still stringing to reach meta to resolve the issue this is the issue

We received an automated email notifying us that our group has been disabled
due to a copyright violation. However, there seems to be some confusion, and
I'd like to clarify a few points:

1. The group post contained a Bubble Gun Toy, which is intended solely
for kids fun use and is not related to firearms.

2. We believe our group's content did not violate any policies copyright
and restricted goods and services, and we'd appreciate your assistance in
reviewing our case. We have attached a screenshot from the Group Quality
section for your reference.

We kindly request your prompt attention and resolution of this issue. Your
positive reply and assistance in resolving this matter would be greatly
appreciated.

Hey Meta my business page was hacked it would be great I could report it and get my page back.
"The past few days ive been getting notifications that someone is trying to log on my account from brazil and this morning i got notifications that someone is trying to log in from china. Ive had 2 step verification turned on for a long time so i havent been worried as i know i am protected.

I got out of bed to check my facebook and its been hacked, name changed and disabled. Now my facebook is gone and my verified page the pic has been changed and i cant get in there neither.

How can this even happen? How is this possible? 2 step verification should protect my account and not let anyone breach or access my account! And how is it even disabled?

I got followers, friends, an adult lifetime memories there and my page is verified since many many years back and its an offical page for me. I need you to help me gain access again to these 2! I have never done anything wrong and never been warned for any posts or anything on facebook. How is this possible?

"My account was hacked just now. Google notif it was from Vietnam. The hacker completely changed the email and phone number associated with my FB account. I was trying the reverse strat but the system says my device was not recognized. Just a few days ago 3 of my FB friend's account was also hacked. This is so alarming. I hope there's a feature that could completely lock our account in the event of a reported hack. Additionally, it would be helpful if our siblings or friends could report a hacked account.

""Hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to seek your assistance in a matter of great importance to me.

To begin with, I would like to convey a sense of frustration and despair I am currently experiencing due to an issue I have encountered. Over the past several years, I have been working on a Facebook page since 2020, and I have spent a significant amount of money without careful consideration, totaling 33,000 Egyptian pounds.

Despite my efforts to adhere to policies and regulations, my page was mistakenly restricted on Facebook, possibly due to an unclear update or technical glitch. This situation has had a significant impact on my morale and business.

I would like to point out that the advertisements are still active and running, and my advertising account number is 598152617856378. However, there has been a clear error that occurred. I am aware that your team has the expertise and capability to assist me in this matter.

Since last Friday, I have been unable to conduct my business, and the situation is persisting in an unacceptable manner. I am reaching out to you for help in resolving this issue and restoring my page.
