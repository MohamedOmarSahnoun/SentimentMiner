"Hello Google and Community, 

we have a business account with Google. The problem is that we changed something there and now we have to confirm it. Unfortunately, we only have one business video to choose from. Since we don't have a real office but simply work from home, we can't make a video from there. Is there an option so we can confirm this via email? If you send an email to Google you only get an automated response, so I'll get in touch this way. Maybe someone from the community can help me?

"Hello Google Team,

Our Google Business profile has been disabled since last Friday. We provided all the relevant proofs & documents of our business, but have received no response. Since we haven't received any response through the usual channels, we are reaching out here on comments for assistance.

We are a leading web design agency with hundreds of 5-star reviews on Google. Having our profile disabled is affecting our business financially, as clients cannot find us on Google, and we must manually send our address for meetings. We are also a Google Partner, spending over $100K monthly on ad spend for our clients. With over 90 emails, we use Google Workspace for our organization & have set up hundreds of emails for our clients.

It's frustrating that Google has disabled our profile without due diligence, especially as we are a credible business. Our profile has been active for over seven years, and this disablement is making it hard for customers to find our address and reviews. We have already submitted two appeals (7-6126000035905 and 3-2763000034690), but it has been almost five days with no response.

We request urgent attention to this matter and can provide any additional information needed.

"Everything that I know I need to learn, I have the awareness to resolve it by maintaining vigilance in making sure I am learning it.
Most importantly,
What I would like to learn is, anything that I’m unaware of that needs to be learned. That brings to question, how do I figure out the obscure things that I’m not yet aware of? Maybe asking for more critical evaluations from my senior leadership? It’s difficult to ask for mentorship, if I don’t know what I’m seeking guidance on.

Just by answering this question, I learned that I should always observe and give constructive criticism to my top performers. While they may be the best at what they do, there’s always room for improvement. Often times during my military evals, once I became knowledgeable I noticed the feedback diminishes. Something I didn’t stress as much before, this exercise taught me that I should learn to communicate better. Also, teach others to do the same and share their criticisms. This will exponentially increase knowledge within the organization and community.

The secret handshake of knowledge. Too many keep knowledge as their personal gain for job retention.
"Hi Google, As a business analyst, I've been diving into the fascinating world of data visualization and research lately. It's amazing how much more we can uncover by exploring different ways to analyze and visualize data. Take, for instance, the surge in the Indian market back in 2014. Many attributed it to the stability brought in by the newly established government. Why does political stability matter? Well, it boosts investor confidence and leads to better decision-making, which can have a ripple effect on economic indicators like the stock market.

My example is not related to any organisation but it gives you an idea why and how data tells you about everything. It's not just about numbers; data tells stories, and visualizing it makes these stories easier to grasp. But it's the research behind it all that really brings everything together, showing us just how powerful data can be.

"Concerns Regarding Inappropriate Content on YouTube Music for Children

I am writing to express my serious concerns regarding the content selection algorithm on YouTube Music, particularly when used in a child-friendly setting.

Despite taking the following precautions:
Using an age-restricted account
Playing from a private playlist
Turning off music suggestions
Setting the playlist to repeat
Selecting soothing music, NOT content from ""The Book of Mormon"".

Inappropriate content, specifically ""Hasa Diga Eebowai"" from ""The Book of Mormon,"" was played to my 19-month-old child on multiple occasions.

This incident raises significant questions about the reliability and appropriateness of YouTube Music's content filtering and selection mechanisms.
It is alarming that despite these safeguards, the platform can still select and play content that is clearly not suitable for a young child, if it happened once ok, but it's happened on multiple occasions over multiple months. An 83.38% price hike.

The ongoing email correspondence with Google Support has reached 70+ emails without a satisfactory resolution, further highlighting the severity and complexity of this issue.

"Friends, there's a narrative being woven by those in power, a tale they spin to keep us blind to the truth. They want to hoard knowledge and control, positioning themselves at the summit while the rest of us struggle below. But what they don't want you to know is that the era of job security is dwindling. 

As machines encroach upon every sector, will they assure you that jobs abound? Will they guide you to opportunities or offer a roadmap to navigate this shifting landscape? No. They'll keep their lips sealed, content in their ivory towers while we grapple with uncertainty.

But fear not, for there's a beacon of enlightenment amidst the darkness. If you're hungry for change and eager to reclaim agency over your future, then heed my words. I invite you to join a webinar, a gateway to knowledge that will shatter illusions and illuminate pathways to empowerment.

Don't remain in the shadows of ignorance. Ask, inquire, and arm yourself with the insights to shape a tomorrow where opportunity isn't a privilege, but a birthright. Let's forge a future where power resides not in the hands of the few, but in the hearts of the many. Are you ready to seize it?

"Google data centers are what I can only imagine my conception of heaven looks like. An Electric Eden. 

In one of my fantasy realms (that takes place in the 2500s), every cloud region (zone, really!) is powered by a localized nuclear power plant that generates off grid power. It was supposed to be my idea of a super futuristic but realistic power source and it's fascinating that it's actually being developed now.

Who could even begin to conceive what data centers will be like in the 2500s? What sort of power sources will we be using?

With data centers consuming roughly 3% of global energy consumption and *growing* we MUST be looking for sustainable ways to power them!

"Such a waste ....start using parts of connected device's HD to crypt data and share it in the world in a network ....decentralise it through user's devices network.

A new web in necessary fair and easier to use.

Chatgpt approx calculation based on world mobile and computers:

Sure, let's do the calculation:

Space shared by computers = 2 billion * 2 GB = 4 billion GB
Space shared by mobile phones = 8 billion * 0.5 GB = 4 billion GB

Now, let's sum up these two:

Total space = 4 billion GB (from computers) + 4 billion GB (from mobile phones) = 8 billion GB

So, you would get a total of 8 billion gigabytes.

This is the REAL user generated web network ....as a computer goes one comes as a device goes.. one other comes ....you should know.

Things come and goes but memory is always higher and efficiency the same ....SO

Specially if mobile gets more and more cheap and full of memory ....slurpppp it

"It's truly inspiring to read about Bserat’s remarkable contributions, both within Google and in the broader community. Her dedication to fostering growth and support for underrepresented groups in tech and beyond showcases the profound impact that focused, compassionate leadership can have. Through initiatives like Google for Startups, and the commitment to elevating Black artists and supporting Black-led VC firms, Bserat and Google are setting a sterling example of how companies can and should leverage their resources and platforms for social good.
The emphasis on community support and the proactive role in promoting diversity and inclusion across various sectors — from tech entrepreneurship to the arts and sports — is commendable. It not only highlights the importance of representation but also the positive cycle of mentorship and opportunity that arises when individuals are supported in their endeavors.
Her efforts to ""pay it forward"" resonate deeply with the principle that success is not just about individual achievement, but also about uplifting others along the way.

"I am being sued for 1.2 million dollars for defamation of character for posting a legitimate review on Google about about sexual battery and sexual harassment that occured with an owner of an estate sale company in Memphis during a business transaction on the property of the estate. I provided evidence that this occured with a screenshot of proceeding text conversation this event where he admits to the battery and the sexual harassment is clear in the texts “I was hoping to bend u over but oh well”, he stuck his hand up my skirt and grabbed my ass, then I am asked how could you possibly feel sexually harassed? Google has now contributed to the “validity” of this ridiculous lawsuit against the VICTIM by honoring the requests to have my reviews (I left two - business and personal) the the facts are INDISPUTABLE from the proceeding text exchange. This completely nullifies any credibility of Google in accuracy representing the integrity and reputation of a business, and also inflicts emotional distress on the recipient of this lawsuit, who not only had to endure that traumatic experience, but now be dismissed by Google and have it covered up?

"Google acting like they care about people. They downright lie. 

I was misled by an 'expert' that worked for Google ads. She told me to raise the budget, I protested. After being pushed several times (because it's necessary or it won't work) I raised the budget, also because I was told I would pay for leads. Turns out the 'expert' had it all wrong. After a month the bill was over €2000,- euros and I didn't get one lead.

The 'expert' said it was probably a bug. So I waited. I then never heard from her again. I had to move heaven and earth to get to talk to someone. When I finally did, they admitted something went wrong because, as they told me, the original 'expert' was receiving coaching because of what happened. Yet, they were still not going to help me because 'you clicked yourself'. Seriously? So you can provide wrong information but then because someone actually clicks themselves you can make a load of money and get away with it? Even if so, is that really how you treat customers?

It got weirder. There was never a coach for the 'expert'. I found out that the 'expert' hadn't worked there in over a month. The coaching line was a downright lie. Why?!

How do you want people to trust you if this is how you treat customers?

Thank you, Jay, for taking steps to build this community and make a lasting impact at Google.

"Thanks for the mention! While I have since stepped down from leading Mixed Googlers, it was definitely a great experience to help build a place of belonging for so many Googlers. There are Multiracial and Multiethnic people in every company so hopefully other companies follow our lead and create their own Mixed ERGs. 

For everyone out there, remember that you don't need ""DEI"" in your title to make a difference in your organization. It is all of our responsibilities to help make our organizations a place of belonging.

"Donner aux politiques son pouvoir de Représentation revient à s'accepter comme esclave, comme étant un animal dépourvu de raison pris dans leurs filets. C'est tourner le dos à sa responsabilité, à sa Liberté aussi relative soit-elle, c'est renoncer à l'usufruit universel que représente cette planète et son abondance. C'est donner son aval à la marchandisation de l'humanité toute entière.
C'est abandonner le principe que l'autre est un autre que soi. C'est s'accepter en tant qu'objet manipulé.
Être humain c'est exister. Exister c'est s'inscrire dans un rapport de dimensionnalité, où les relations de causalité remontent à la notion fondamentale de création.
L'univers est, il existe. Nous sommes, nous existons dans la spatialité tridimensionnelle que notre esprit peut percevoir, nous sommes par voie de conséquence des êtres quadridimensionnels unifiés par le pouvoir du VERBE. En effet c'est par le fondement de la verbalisation que nous unifions tout ce qui est, nous Définissons l'Image de ce qui EST Unifié. Г

Over 10 years later, I am now her full-time caregiver. I'll never forget the kindness and understanding that my team bestowed on me while I worked remote to help her heal.

"I’ve spent many years caring for youth as a volunteer, but with corporate influence and knowledge. My hope was that it would be infectious. Iron sharpening iron. Being fortunate enough to stand on the shoulders of many, obligated me to pour into others. As a natural servant, caregiver, it’s means the world to have support of my leadership. Allowing me the opportunity to borrow time to make an a larger impact on my community. Not because I thrive to be in the spotlight (that isn’t my role) but to allow me to fully flourish in my gifts. My return to the company is 150% effort. My loyalty is the prize for allowing me to be who I am- naturally and without backlash. Shout out to caregivers!! 💪🏾

"Google acting like they care. Nonsense. They downright lie. 

I was misled by an 'expert' that worked for Google ads. She told me to raise the budget, I protested. After being pushed several times (because it's necessary or it won't work) I raised the budget, also because I was told I would pay for leads. Turns out the 'expert' had it all wrong. After a month the bill was over €2000,- euros and I didn't get one lead.

The 'expert' said it was probably a bug. So I waited. I then never heard from her again. I had to move heaven and earth to get to talk to someone. When I finally did, they admitted something went wrong because, as they told me, the original 'expert' was receiving coaching because of what happened. Yet, they were still not going to help me because 'you clicked yourself'. Seriously? So you can provide wrong information but then because someone actually clicks themselves you can make a load of money and get away with it? Even if so, is that really how you treat customers?

It got weirder. There was never a coach for the 'expert'. I found out that the 'expert' hadn't worked there in over a month. The coaching line was a downright lie. Why?!

How do you want people to trust you if this is how you treat customers?

That man kicked a dog in broad daylight, on camera. Ironic how you post dogs on your page for Valentine's but don't address the Eric Morrison incident. Or was that done to cover your tracks and make clear that your stance is you care about animals...yet make no moves to care about this disgusting incident.

My aspirations to work for Google are no longer existent. Although, now I know that that I'll definitely be better off in my career one day. Because if Eric Morrison, dog kicker/abuser, can make it to UX designer for the mighty Google, the sky's the limit for someone who is a good person.

"Yeah, regarding AI its important to note that it must be used for the benefit of mankind. It uses an extremely large amount of data. So using for larger applications to help make our lives easier is very important. I see the future of AI as well as ML as taking the physical hardware and shrinking its size, power, and improving its efficiency.

These systems should not only prevent negative impacts—such as privacy breaches or misinformation—but also enhance human interactions and support our capabilities.

"Are you aware of the urgent turn of events regarding the UN’s Pandemic Treaty?
We're in the final stretch, and the stakes couldn't be higher.
A shocking move looks set to attack our basic freedoms, handing over way too much power to the World Health Organization to control how nations handle health crises and your personal health decisions.
This pivotal moment could redefine your liberties, impacting every facet of how you live, work, and make choices about your health and future.
The voices of millions of concerned people worldwide slowed them down, yet they're rallying, pushing to seal this dirty deal by the 27th of May.
They're desperate, willing even to settle for a diluted treaty, just to claim a 'win.'
But this 'win' for them is a loss for us, stripping away layers of your freedom, inch by inch.
They're convening yet again, in an extra meeting, starting next Monday, April 29, born out of their panic, to patch up their differences and ram this treaty through.
And let's not kid ourselves - their hurried compromise will still bear consequences for us all, trampling over our rights under the guise of global health.

Why does the Google corporation not accept my legal letters? They return them to Poland without even opening them.
They deleted all of my websites in so many countries within one hour—a planned attack. They left my competitors' sites untouched, likely having received a substantial bribe. This has caused me massive losses, leading to the closure of my company, employee layoffs, and bankruptcy. The Google corporation is trying to kill me. People, help! They want to kill me.

"!!! Why did the Google corporation remove and block my websites, legally operating in many countries, that were dedicated to informing people about threats and working for the benefit of the community? Why did Google delete all my sites at once, causing me to lose everything? Why did they do this while leaving the websites of my competitors, who are thriving?
Why does the Google corporation not accept my legal letters? They return them to Poland without even opening them.
They deleted all of my websites in so many countries within one hour—a planned attack. They left my competitors' sites untouched, likely having received a substantial bribe. This has caused me massive losses, leading to the closure of my company, employee layoffs, and bankruptcy. The Google corporation is trying to kill me. People, help! They want to kill me.
My question is as follows: Why is Google doing this? Is it because, for years, I have been developing my own independent, competitive organic internet search engine? Perhaps that's why they are trying to destroy me, taking these actions to prevent me from succeeding right from the start.

"The situation in Gaza is deeply concerning. The complete cut-off of communications and the Internet not only hampers the ability of civilians to stay informed but also puts their safety and well-being at risk. Reports of increased violence in the region, more intense than before, only compound the dire circumstances.

In this digital age, access to communication and information is a fundamental right, and the blackout in Gaza further exacerbates an already precarious situation. The international community should be vigilant and work towards re-establishing these essential communication channels to ensure that people can stay connected and informed about their surroundings.

The use of hashtags like
,
demonstrates the power of social media and the digital space in raising awareness and advocating for change. It is crucial for people worldwide to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza and call for an end to the violence and a restoration of their communication infrastructure.

The suffering of civilians in conflict zones is a global concern, and it is the responsibility of governments and international organizations to work towards peace and the protection of innocent lives.

"The support system for self-improvement and recovery has truly demonstrated remarkable growth on both an individual and communal level. It's crucial for people to realize that there's no one-size-fits-all solution; we're all works in progress on a journey of continuous improvement. Embracing both the highs and lows is what makes humanity beautiful – it's about owning everything, acknowledging the good and the bad. This synergy is what fosters inclusivity and understanding, especially for someone navigating a recent diagnosis of Friedrich's Ataxia. More power to everyone on this journey.

"Dear Google Team,

I must express my deep frustration with the Google recovery email process, particularly the estimated 30-day time limit. In today's fast-paced world, 30 days for recovery is not just excessive; it's outrageous, inconvenient, and out of touch with the reality of the digital age.

The very essence of technology is speed, efficiency, and adaptability. Why, then, does Google impose this seemingly arbitrary 30-day deadline? It's high time for a major update in this regard. Waiting for an entire month to regain access to crucial accounts and data is not acceptable, especially in cases where time is of the essence.

Let's strive for user-centric solutions and not hinder people with unreasonable delays. I urge you to take action swiftly and provide an update that aligns with the demands of our dynamic world.

Your quick and efficient reply not only addressed my concerns but also reflects the proactivity and dedication of the Google team. It's a testament to the commitment of your team to ensuring a positive user experience.

CC-BY-SA also contains another provision related to attribution, 3.a.3
(CC-BY as well):
""If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.""

Does this provision ""survive"" the licensing of an adaptation under FAL?

In my understanding, yes, and the same reasons apply to CC-BY. If this
understanding is incorrect, please tell. I've learned there are CC-BY-SA
licensors for whom this provision matters, at least as a theoretical way
out.

No, because of section 2(a)(5)(B) of BY-SA 4.0, which says:

""Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted
Material under the conditions of the Adapter?s License You apply.""

When someone applies the FAL to an adaptation of a BY-SA work, technically
both the FAL and BY-SA apply to the full adaptation because both the
adapter and the original author have rights in the work. However, because
of the BY-SA 4.0 provision cited above, downstream users of the adaptation
are able to satisfy their obligations under both licenses by looking only
at the conditions in the FAL. As you point out, the FAL does not have an
attribution removal clause like BY-SA does.

[Note: the non-ShareAlike 4.0 licenses such as CC BY do not have this
provision. In those cases, the attribution removal clause (and all of the
attribution requirements) would ""follow"" the adaptation regardless of what
license was applied to it.]

Young guy is out on a blind date. Meets young woman in a coffee shop. They say hello, and then there is an awkward silence. Young woman tries to break it, so she asks:
'Don't you want to know anything about me?'

Young man responds: 'Nah, I'm good. I Googled you before coming here.'

Every now and then my computer asks if I want to change my search engine. No way, I say. It's always been Google, and shall always remain so.

25 For this reason I say to you, [q]do not be worried about your [r]life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on.Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing?26 Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather crops into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more important than they?27And which of you by worrying can add a single [s]day to his [t]life’s span?28 And why are you worried about clothing? Notice how the lilies of the field grow; they do not labor nor do they spin thread for cloth, 29 yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you?
You of little faith! 31 Do not worry then, saying, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear for clothing?’32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But [u]seek first [v]His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be [w]provided to you.

"Ortega señala otras dos categorías de la vida, que serían las siguientes:
La vida es fatalidad y libertad. El mundo que nos ha tocado vivir no es algo que podamos elegir; la circunstancia en la que se desenvuelve nuestra vida determina nuestro yo. Pero sin la concreción que implica la circunstancia nos sería imposible ser y actuar: la vida es siempre estar en una circunstancia, el mundo vital es nuestro aquí y ahora y es a partir de él como debemos actuar y modelar nuestro futuro; este hecho permite la libertad, pues la pura indeterminación la haría imposible. Existe la libertad: la circunstancia nos permite un cierto margen de posibilidades y nos exige decidir: la vida se presenta siempre como un problema, que nadie excepto nosotros puede resolver, y tiene un carácter dramático; estamos arrojados a la existencia y nos toca elegir y participar; en consecuencia tenemos proyectos, que han de ser fieles a nuestro ser, a nuestro destino; así, la vida es libertad, y debe ser responsabilidad.
