A thing called spudnuts! Here on the east side of Washington is one of only around 30 spudnuts shops in the country. Tastier and less dense than regular donuts.
Definitely bagel. The fact that it is chewy serves as a massage to the temples and relaxes the tension accumulated from the active mental work….
Bacon and egg sandwich
A few hours Teams meeting is my breakfast
"Bagel. I can make half sweet and half savory, dress it however I want. It will also help keep me full longer. Eat a donut, hungry in 30 minutes… eat a bagel, hungry in a couple of hours."
Bagel! Toasted goodness with butter. Butter is a six letter word for love.
Neither. No carbs for breakfast
Energy drink and gas station pizza! For the ages.
Bagels because they have less sugar than donuts although a bagel alone is not necessarily an adequate meal. Bread has been a staple crop for humanity since the Agricultural Revolution.

Absolutely unacceptable!"
Go back thru your old Facebooks and MySpace profiles and facial recognition your bosses. The people that work at a lot of these companies stole the money they used to start them and then pretended to get investments from their grandparents years after they were deceased.. look it up please.

Can we pass legislation to make infrared lights on streets legal and mandatory so we can turn off all these visible spectrum lights and see the stars again meanwhile vehicles and cameras sensors can see just fine
Got forced update last night. Now my touch screen on my Surface doesn't work. Missing drivers. Ran your fix it app. didn't do anything but says everything is working fine. It's not. Tried all the other fixes Microsoft suggested. None of them worked. It's missing drivers. Why can't I just go to the drivers page like in the past? Been waiting for online help in chat for 30+ minutes and nothing. Already wasted 3 hours. Why can't you make sure your updates work before pushing them. TIme to replace with non Microsoft products.
"Does Microsoft know that in their latest Office update for Macs that a Trojan virus malware that somehow got embedded in the Excel system configuration was sent out to all their users? My husband and I do daily virus scans and found it. The only way we could get rid of it, was to delete the entire Excel application. I would have expected Microsoft to make sure such things like this doesn’t happen."

"I skipped, or walked out of every meeting i was invited to.. I prefer to be productive."
"45 minute max, non-back-to-back should be a global rule!"
Normalize not so many meetings! Pretty sure upper management schedules all these meetings because they have nothing to do. The people actually working could get more done if we didn’t have to sit in irrelevant meetings.
"Anyone who says meetings are unproductive clearly can't lead one. I'm a developer, and even I know how to run productive meetings. They are the absolute best and most effective way to communicate and get answers."
I like taking a 10 year break in between meetings.
"If I have back-to-backs, then I just leave early or show up late. Not my fault someone scheduled them back-to-back."
We find decompressing by chatting with Logan to be a great way to break up the cycle. It’s so good when someone “gives you back 5 minutes” to just dump in the brain mess and get some clarity before moving into the next conversation.
